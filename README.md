# Lottery-Ticketing-System
A web application that allows users to create accounts and log in so that they can purchase and manage lottery tickets.<br>
The user's information is stored when they sign up and requires their account to be authenticated when they sign in. The tickets they buy are stored under their account so they can view and manage them. Additionally, admin accounts have a separate login so that they can generate random lottery numbers when required for the next lottery.<br>

The application uses React.js and CSS for the front end and Node.js to communicate with the database, which in the case of this application is a JSON file. <br>
Example execution: While in the auth file type: node app.js in order to start the node server and in the Login file type npm start to host the website on localhost<br>
